Getting started with AWS is hard. This blog series and tutorial is meant for new users to jump into an actionable project. It takes a bit of upfront set-up and clicking buttons that you may not fully understand right now. That's ok. I don't know how it works either, and I'm a professional.
</p>

<p>
With about 30 minutes of effort, it's possible to set up developing applications for the cloud. This tutorial is intended to get you there, and then keep you going. We'll do this by speed-running account creation, initial administrator set up, and installing the necessary software: the AWS CLI, and the AWS SAM CLI. That's what this initial post is for. It is a pre-requisite for cloud engineering, there is no short cut here. You have to have an AWS Account, and you have to be able to access that account from your command line.
</p>

<p>
From there, in a future blog, we'll begin developing a simple <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> locally. Then, we'll talk about deploying it and executing in the cloud. And lastly - we'll turn that lambda into a side hustle.
</p>

<p>
This guide is built around this documentation: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/prerequisites.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/prerequisites.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Frankly, this is the best place to start &#x2013; right from the horses mouth. Treat my guide as merely your enabler, your rock, through this trying time.

<p>
Creating an account is free and easy!
</p>

<p>
It's a 5-step process, and requires an email and a credit card. You will NOT be charged for anything inititally. It's possible to get yourself into trouble, but unlikely. I would NOT recommend clicking randomly in the console. Treat the console with respect, it is possible to rack up bills.

The user you created your account with is like a business owner. It's the over-arching identity of the organization that owns the account &#x2013; but that's not your IT guy!

<p>
Your primary IT guy is your administrator! They're the ones who do all the work in the console, not the business owner, yuck!

<p>
These instructions are for the command line installer, and assume you have sudo access to your computer.
</p>

<p>
First:
</p>
<pre class="example">
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
</pre>

<p>
Then:
</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
</pre>

<p>
Outputs:
</p>
<pre class="example">
maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"

maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
Password:
installer: Package name is AWS Command Line Interface
installer: Installing at base path /
installer: The install was successful.
</pre>

<p>
Validating your outputs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
which aws
</pre>

<pre class="example">
aws --version
</pre>

<p>
Outputs (if successful):
</p>
<pre class="example">
maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % which aws

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Now, we'll enable our local machines to communicate with the cloud environment, by applying the credentials we created for our IT Adminstrator to our local machine.
</p>

<pre class="example">
maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: &lt;pasted from the key you generated prior&gt;
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: &lt;pasted from the key you generated prior&gt;
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
</pre>

<p>
Now, you're ready to get started with the AWS SAM CLI &#x2013; or any AWS Cloud product for that matter.

Getting started with cloud computing is hard. It's really hard. In this business, we call this <code>boiling the ocean</code> or <code>drinking from the firehose</code>. It's a lot. In this guide, we're going to work in small chunks leading up towards deploying cloud resources that can be invoked from the live internet.
</p>

<p>
There are not many short cuts we can take to developing cloud applications, but there are ways we can accelerate toward doing the fun stufff &#x2013; building your shiny application &#x2013; while saving complexity for later.
</p>

<p>
My recommendation is to start with what you do know: building applications on your local machine. If we can set up our local machine the way Amazon wants us to, we'll be in a great position to iterate quickly and build great software. Plus, no matter where your engineering journey takes you, you'll always have a strong platform to start from. So, let's jump in to building and deploying our first AWS Lambda.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1f41e4e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1f41e4e"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Installing the SAM CLI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
We're going to start with the SAM CLI so that we can build our lambda locally. Then we'll work on deploying that lambda to the cloud. Once we have something existing in the cloud, we'll talk about invoking it from the internet. Then we'll make that lambda do cool stuff.
</p>

Documentation: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm following the instructions titled "Command line - All users"
</p>

<p>
First I've downloaded the recommended pkg installer, and I moved it to my ~ folder, as shown here:
</p>

<pre class="example">
maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % ls -ltr ~/aws-sam-cli-macos-arm64.pkg 
-rw-r--r--@ 1 maxfrey  staff  44104951 Jun 17 14:40 /Users/maxfrey/aws-sam-cli-macos-arm64.pkg
</pre>

<p>
Continuing with the instructions, run the following commands, and validate your installation.
<code>sudo installer -pkg aws-sam-cli-macos-arm64.pkg -target /</code>
</p>

<pre class="example">
maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % sudo installer -pkg aws-sam-cli-macos-arm64.pkg -target /
installer: Package name is AWS SAM CLI
installer: Installing at base path /
installer: The install was successful.
maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % which sam
/usr/local/bin/sam
maxfrey@Maxs-Mac-mini ~ % sam --version
SAM CLI, version 1.86.1
</pre>

<p>
That's it! With the AWS CLI installed, and the AWS SAM CLI installed, you have everything you need to begin developing lambdas.
</p>

<p>
Now find yourself a cozy garage to code in, and launch your start-up.
