subtitle: I make a living implementing the things I learn 
---

I've been writing code for about 10 years. I started with a computer science minor at the University of Wisconsin, and never looked back.

I was a good student in grade school, and did fine in college. But the day that I learned how logic gates can be combined to implement a "logical adder", my jaw dropped. In 15 years of public education, someone finally said something to me that astounded me and capitivated my attention. 

For the first time, I started learning things because I was interested in them.

In the 10 years that have followed, I've learned a lot about implementing software engineering projects. I want to emphasize that: I specialize in solving problems for businesses with technology. I emphasize this because for the first 5 years of my career, I wrote terrible code. Terrible, awful, ugly, working code. I love learning to code -- but more important than the art of writing great code, is the art of solving problems that business leaders care about.

In year 5 of my career, I started learning how to write robust code. Code that was testable, reusable, and maintainable. I don't want to call this _good_ code (I have many thoughts about the illusize _best practices_ we all want), but I'll say -- it's code that is worthy of productionalization at a heavily regulated financial institution.

This blog exists to help me solidy and store my learnings on what it is I've learned. It'll have tips and tricks some of which may even approach _best practices_. I hope you enjoy it and learn something too.

Please, never hesitate to reach out to me with questions, suggestions, and to tell me I'm wrong. This is information I'm spreading like wildfire, so if you think there's an area to improve, I'm all ears. Just be nice about it, we're all here because we love to learn and share ideas.
